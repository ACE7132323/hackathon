# Partner Challenges

## Terra's Challenge:
We are an opinionated Layer 1 platform. As we have relationships with most major liquidity providers and investors in DeFi and crypto, we recommend exploring the following themes to make the most of the hackathon.

1. Understand core themes.
2. Identify technologies and areas of interest.
3. Identify suitable skill match.


**Extending Stablecoin Adoption**

*Beginner to intermediate developers.*

Take advantage of TerraUSD native stablecoins to introduce crypto-native experiences: subscription payments and micropayments, yield-bearing escrow, milestone or instant payroll, creative remittance solutions.



**Decentralized Asset Management**

*For beginner and intermediate frontend developers.*

Over 20% of users of Mirror are in Thailand. Interact with Terra.js, Mirror.js to build decentralized front ends for Mirror. This is a core priority for TFL to enable censorship resistant asset management across borders.



**Crypto Native Financial Primitives**

*Intermediate to Advanced Developers*

Extend primitives available within the Terra ecosystem. For example, DAO treasury issue bonds issuance, revenue sharing agreements, income sharing agreements, DAO creation and management cross-chain liquidity, traunching.



**Picks and Shovels**

*Advanced developers*

One of the highest leverage opportunities in the ecosystem is to enable other developers and builders. Create indexers, block explorers, and developer facing tooling to fix issues every developer will face into the future.





## Maddock Capital's Challenges:

Theme, *"Reduction of the broker / middleman tax in all financial marketplaces"*

Preamble: blockchain technologies power is to reduce transaction friction and transaction costs across all marketplaces in a mature and efficient ecosystem. Currently nearly every financial transaction undertaken has a "broker tax" applied to it. Harmony's infrastructure enables that to be materially reduced.

Currently most online businesses, particularly early stage startups and more mature tech businesses with recurring revenue have limited recourse to raise money outside of equity rounds. Typically, equity raises when advised by financial intermediaries charge 5-7% of proceeds. A blockchain enabled Crowdfunding solution for equity in these businesses (ideally native to and utilising blockchain technologies) could significantly disrupt this market by bringing new sources of capital to these businesses. In short, improve access through designing a 2-sided marketplace for equity raises.

Similarly these businesses currently are not able to raise debt. Current solutions are focused on securitising or forward selling revenues linked to recurring contract income.

In short we want you to disrupt online platforms providing marketplaces to forward sell revenues and contract receivables.

Our view is that this would require the Use of a stable coin pegged to the USD in the first instance. This should enable any blockchain participant to put their capital to work for real growth.





## Chainlink's Challenge:

The development of price feeds delivered via a decentralized oracle network has facilitated the emergence of DeFi applications at scale. Chainlink current offers a variety of additional smart contract services such as verifiable randomness, fair sequencing services and keepers that are also allowing developers to create new and innovate applications. The concept of decentralized oracle networks outlined in the the Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper outlines a future where different constellations of nodes collaborate to process a wide range of workloads. In similarity to how DeFi projects are composable, we envision a future in which the services that facilitate the emergence of new applications are also composable. The purpose of this challenge is to identify the next generation of smart contract services that can be delivered via decentralized oracle networks to allow developers to create new products, new sources of value and ultimately facilitate the emergence of the next wave of blockchain innovation.
