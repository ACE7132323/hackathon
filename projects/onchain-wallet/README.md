1Wallet is a digital wallet for crypto assets, investment and identity. Consumers can buy crypto assets via credit cards, then trade between multiple platforms. They can earn fixed-rate interests or actively invest for higher returns. Their profiles can hold digital arts or custom domain names.

The repo included in this directory contains 4 elements:

1. Smart Contract
2. Relayer
3. CLI tools
4. Front-end web app (React)

The core of the wallet logic resides in the smart contract. You can either use the CLI or the web app at [https://1wallet.crazy.one](https://1wallet.crazy.one) to test the wallet end-to-end.

The front-end application currently serves as a demo but developers are encouraged to build their own clients on top of this framework.

Some suggested ideas are:

- Native iOS and Android mobile apps
- Chrome Extension and SDKs for seamlessly integrating the wallet into web apps.
