### General guideline developers helping with creating hackathon materials like porting Dapp, creating video tutorials, etc.

* Make sure the tutorial video quality is good. As, we want to publish this for onboarding developers from web2/web3 as is.
* Keep the tutorial focus on the Dapp and not the context about why you chose to create it.
* Make the title about Dapp, e.g., "Tutorial on building a simple marketplace Dapp on Harmony", "Tutorial on building a simple Dapp that uses IPFS as decentralized storage", etc.
