# Idea

Enable cross chain transfers using a stable coin AMM for bridge pools.

# Overview

At time of writing Harmony has [$95 Million of Bridged Assets](https://bridge.harmony.one/tokens). To move these assets across chains they need to be swapped to the corresponding bridged asset on Harmony. This is currently done via AMM'S with standard bonding curves, however a stable coin AMM can provide a more efficient swap with lower slippage.
